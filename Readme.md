# Upload Control for ASP.NET Web Forms - How to upload an image and display it on a web page

This example demonstrates how to use the [Upload Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/8298/components/file-management/file-upload) to upload an image to the server and then show it on a web page.

## Overview

Follow the steps below to display an image on a web page once a user uploads the image to the server:

1. Create the *Images* folder in the root folder of your project. In the newly created folder, place an image that you want to initially display.

2. Add the [HTML \<img\> tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp) to a page. Use the tag's **id** attribute to specify the tag identifier. Assign the path to the image you want to initially display to the tag's **src** attribute. The **alt** attribute allows you to specify an alternate text for the image.

3. Add the [ASPxUploadControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxUploadControl?p=netframework) to the page. Set the control's [ShowUploadButton](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxUploadControl.ShowUploadButton?p=netframework) property to `true` to allow users to upload files. Use the [ValidationSettings.AllowedFileExtensions](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.UploadControlValidationSettings.AllowedFileExtensions?p=netframework) property to prevent users from uploading files other than images.

4. Handle the upload control's server-side [FileUploadComplete](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxUploadControl.FileUploadComplete?p=netframework) event. The [UploadedFile](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.FileUploadCompleteEventArgs.UploadedFile?p=netframework) event argument allows you to get the uploaded file as an [UploadedFile](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.UploadedFile) object. Call the object's [SaveAs](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.UploadedFile.SaveAs(System.String)) method to save the uploaded file to the "~/Images/" directory. Set the [CallbackData](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.FileUploadCompleteEventArgs.CallbackData) event argument to *Images/\<filename\>*, where \<filename\> is a full name of the file you saved.

    > **Note**  
    > Unlike the `CallbackData` property value, the path to the directory where you save files should include the application root directory ("~/").

5. Handle the upload control's client-side [FileUploadComplete](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/js-ASPxClientUploadControl.FileUploadComplete?p=netframework) event. In the event handler, use the [getElementById](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/document/getelementbyid) method to access the `<img>` tag by its identifier. Set the **src** attribute of the tag to the value of the[callbackData](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/js-ASPxClientUploadControlFileUploadCompleteEventArgs.callbackData) event argument.  received from the server.
